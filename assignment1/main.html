                    <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                        section 1.10.32.
                    </p>
                    <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                        in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                        Rackham.

                        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
                            suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
                            even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
                            sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                            generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
                            first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
                            with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
                            The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                            non-characteristic words etc.</p>
